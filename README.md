# COMA-PATIENT-MONITORING-SYSTEM-
Developed a machine learning-powered software employing Seaborn,
OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras, and NumPy libraries to continuously monitor patient
movements. The system promptly sends alerts to designated guardians and the
attending doctor upon detecting any significant movement changes.
